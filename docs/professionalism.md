## The importance of staying as professional as possible

The reason I'm writing this is that I decided to make this repo public on Github today, and my first goal was to clean up the repo for public consumption.  It was in no way bad, but it's just easier to consume the information if the person writing is trying to focus on one and only one thing - providing the information you need in the most effective and efficient way possible.  Therefore, certain things aren't generally helpful in my opinion:
* Casual words / speaking tone used throughout documentation, code comments, etc when a more direct and serious approach would be more effective
* Pop culture / other references clogging up documentation
* Cute/funsy names of important things - like very relevant variables or services/servers

I think they can add flavor if used sparingly in the right situations. However, the risk to go overboard with it and create a worse product with extremely limited potential benefits from its use makes me want to overswing the other way and just recommend that everyone be as professional as possible, 100% of the time, and leave that stuff out.  

Somewhat unrelated, I also think it's a great idea to target beginners in your documentation.  If you remove any bad assumptions about the reader's knowledge, you can do your best to provide hints / breadcrumbs to help them navigate around and learn what they need to know from any given starting point in your documentation or code.  At least, that's what we should shoot for.
