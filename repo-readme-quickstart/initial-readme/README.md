## $$REPLACE$$ - Add your repo name

## Welcome!
1. Members of my team are expected to:
    * Familiarize themselves with this documentation ([quickstarted with markmadej/team-agreement](https://github.com/markmadej/team-agreement))
    * Propose new ideas and improvements when they :lightbulb:
    * Adhere to the rules defined within this repo
1. You are a respected member of this team, if you'd like to participate.  Let's make this the best team we possibly can.
1. If you have an idea to make this repo better, please [create an issue]($$REPO$$/issues/new) or better yet, [submit a pull request]($$REPO$$/pulls).

This repo contains a set of rules that the team finds important enough to discuss and adhere to.  This will include guidelines on process (how issues are created, what steps they flow through, etc).  There may be some technology-specific things, there will be more general things.  Whatever the team finds to be relevant and important will be included within this repo.  Anything defined in this repo should welcome a challenge or question from a team member, and anything can be changed via PR.  

## Github Issues, and labels to help track our progress
$$AUR$$
We will use Github Issues to track ideas and things we are working on.  It's free, it's integrated into Github, it's simple.  

### Labels
$$AUR$$
Labels let our teammates know the current status of a given Issue.  This is a comprehensive list of each label, its purpose, and its proposed color (for consistency across repos if desired).

* ![#FF0000](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) `#FF0000` **Blocked** : This issue is blocked for some reason (see comments).  
* ![#E0E0E0](https://placehold.it/15/e0e0e0/000000?text=+) `#E0E0E0` **Needs Grooming** : This issue requires more grooming before work can begin.  
* ![#3333FF](https://placehold.it/15/3333ff/000000?text=+) `#3333FF` **Ready For Dev** : This issue has well-defined AC and is ready for dev work. 
* ![#00FF00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) `#00FF00` **In Progress** : This issue is actively being worked on.  
* ![#FF9933](https://placehold.it/15/ff9933/000000?text=+) `#FF9933` **Ready For Review** : This issue has a PR that is ready for review. 
* ![#FF3399](https://placehold.it/15/ff3399/000000?text=+) `#FF3399` **Not Critical Path** : This issue may be important in the future, but it is not in the critical path for now.  Prioritize other issues if possible.

Note - we originally had a label for `Closed` but I didn't think it made sense to keep this since you can just close an issue.
 
### Markdown
$$AUR$$
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is the current standard for documentation across all repos when possible.
