# Repo README Quickstart
## Assumptions
This document assumes that you have already determined that you want to use `team-agreement` as a starting point for your project.  Thank you for giving this a try!  Check out the main README if you aren't yet sure and want to learn more.  

## How to get set up
You'll want to copy the contents of [the `initial-readme` directory](https://github.com/markmadej/team-agreement/tree/master/repo-readme-quickstart/initial-readme) to your new project directory.  Within the files, you'll need to replace certain things with your project-specific information. 

## Variables

### `$$REPO$$`
Your full Github repo URL, ie. `https://github.com/markmadej/team-agreement`

### `$$REPLACE$$`
Generic field that you need to insert content in, of any size.

### `$$AUR`
Shorthand for accept/update/remove.  Applies to the current section.  Your options:
1. Accept this section as is.
1. Update this section to meet your needs.
1. Remove it if you feel it's unnecessary.  You can also create a ticket to create this section later (although you risk never doing that by removing the visual annoyance from the README text).
