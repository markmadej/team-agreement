# team-agreement
A generic team agreement, to be used as a starting point for new projects.

## Quickstart for potential users
Are you looking for the fastest path to creating a new repo based on this team agreement?  [Click here for the Repo README.md Quickstart](repo-readme-quickstart/README.md).

## Why create a generic team agreement?
1. I feel that, in theory, I could build an app (or any project) from scratch and do all of the work myself.
1. I know in reality that if I want to build anything of serious complexity, I'll need to rely on others to help.
1. I know that even very small teams work much better with a clear, understood, and evolvable set of rules.
1. I have been on a team that tried to create a team agreement and failed due to bad attitudes, and that was frustrating.  We can do better.  
1. I know that I will gain value from this even as a 1 person team.
1. I know that other teams would benefit by having an opinionated team agreement to start from and modify to their heart's content.

## Welcome!
1. Members of my team are expected to:
    * Familiarize themselves with this documentation
    * Propose new ideas and improvements when they :lightbulb:
    * Adhere to the rules defined within this repo
1. You are a respected member of this team, if you'd like to participate.  Let's make this the best team we possibly can.
1. This team agreement is intended to be used across any / all repos by any team that finds it useful.  Creating a standard process will make it smoother to contribute across multiple projects.
1. If you have an idea to make this repo better, just [create an issue](https://github.com/markmadej/team-agreement/issues) or better yet, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/markmadej/team-agreement/pulls).

This repo contains a set of rules that the team finds important enough to discuss and adhere to.  This will include guidelines on process (how issues are created, what steps they flow through, etc).  There may be some technology-specific things, there will be more general things.  Whatever the team finds to be relevant and important will be included within this repo.  Anything defined in this repo should welcome a challenge or question from a team member, and anything can be changed via PR.  

## Professionalism
This seems very formal.  There are reasons why I feel we will work best together this way.  I will try to keep the writings in this repo as professional, clear, and targeted towards beginners as possible.  Extending that to the code we write in other repos that use this team agreement makes sense as well.  [Here are a few more thoughts](docs/professionalism.md) if you are interested.

## Push and ignore failure
> Early refactor thoughts - maybe I should create a "principles" or "team dynamics" section and separate that out

Creating is difficult.  Just as writers get writers block, it's easy to "lock up" sometimes and have difficulty making a decision.  I'm adding this section because even when cleaning up this repo for public consumption, I feel anxiety about what I'm writing and how I could make it better.  I think in general, it's best to pick a path forward and keep working, and push through / ignore that anxiety as best you can.  I guess the reason I'm adding this is to give myself permission to create imperfect content in an attempt to try get as much done as possible.

## Caveats for small teams
With a single or very small number of engineers working in these repos, we should strive to make the process as friction-free as possible.  There may be steps we can take out of the process that provide good value with minimum risk (especially for systems that are not in production).  This section contains those proposed rule modifications.

WARNING : In most cases (or all cases if you prefer), it's better to just follow the standard process.  These rules are not recommendations.  They're giving you the ability to skip some redundant steps when it's clear that they don't add value.
1. Labels (see next section) are unnecessary if you're working on something that you:
    * Are confident you will complete during your current work session
    * Don't think they will add value
1. Go ahead and commit directly to master for non-controversial documentation changes.  
    * However, please add a short commit note that you specifically thought about this and didn't think it was necessary.
