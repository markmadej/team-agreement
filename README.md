# team-agreement
Wow.  I never thought I would want to do project management as a hobby.  But here we are.

## WTF is this?
I've reached the point where:
1. I feel that, in theory, I could build an app (or any project) from scratch and do all of the work myself.
1. I know in reality that if I want to build anything of serious complexity, I'll need to rely on others to help.
1. I know that even very small teams work much better with a clear, understood, and evolvable set of rules.
1. I know that I will gain value from this even as a 1 person team.  

This repo contains a set of rules that the team finds important enough to discuss and adhere to.  This will include guidelines on process (how issues are created, what steps they flow through, etc).  There may be some technology-specific things, there will be more general things.  Whatever the team finds to be relevant and important will be included within this repo.  Anything defined in this repo should welcome a challenge or question from a team member, and anything can be changed via PR.  

## High-level repo facts
1. Members of my team are expected to:
    1. Familiarize theirselves with this documentation
    1. Propose new ideas and improvements when they :lightbulb:
    1. Adhere to the rules defined within this repo
1. You are a respected member of this team, if you'd like to participate.  Let's make this the best team we possibly can.
1. This team agreement is intended to be used across any / all repos that I am collaborating with others on.  Creating a standard process will make it smoother to contribute across multiple projects.
1.  This format looks like trash now.  Feel free to improve it, or I'll get to it at some point.  :)
